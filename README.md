XtraBYtes is a newly invented algorithm that does not require any traditional type of mining support, such as: POW or POS. 
We have created something called Proof of Signature which ensure that 100% of all blocks will be signed by the system when 
they occur. The blocks are signed by the system after verifying the transactions in the block. There are a total of 
650 million XBY and there will never be more. 

The XtraBYtes system is a BLOCKTECH SUPERCHAIN which will start with a database storage system that will never break like 
some systems because we do not rely on miners who could turn their rigs to other coins, leaving the network unable to verify 
and therefore breaking the blockchain, rendering it useless and thus all clients losing access to their stored files. This 
can never happen to XtraBYtes.

Additional services will include: X-Secure Contracts, X-Protect Patents, X-Actions Financial tools, X-Chat Messaging and 
other high interest Blockchain Innovations.

The system functions through a network of trusted STaTiC nodes which are connected both physically and virtually through our 
unique and powerful VITALS network with consistent global communications through the PULSE message system which ensures all 
blocks are signed and secured within function specific time frames.
